# CostSummaryBoxes - Real Data Integration

The CostSummaryBoxes component is now fully integrated with your AdminPage to work with **real facility data** from your database.

## 🎯 Integration Details

### **Location in AdminPage**
- **Tab**: Company Facility Documents (Tab 5)
- **Position**: Right after the header section, before the facility cards
- **Display**: Shows cost summary for each facility in your database

### **Real Data Mapping**

The component automatically maps your facility data structure:

```typescript
// Your facility data structure
{
  _id: string;
  facilityName: string;
  rentAgreement: {
    monthlyRent: number;
    startDate: string;
    endDate: string;
    securityDeposit?: number;
    securityDepositAmortization?: number;
  };
}

// Maps to CostSummaryBoxes props
<CostSummaryBoxes
  monthlyRent={parseFloat(facility.rentAgreement?.monthlyRent) || 0}
  startDate={new Date(facility.rentAgreement?.startDate || new Date())}
  endDate={new Date(facility.rentAgreement?.endDate || new Date())}
  securityDeposit={parseFloat(facility.rentAgreement?.securityDeposit) || 0}
  amortizationPeriodMonths={parseInt(facility.rentAgreement?.securityDepositAmortization) || 12}
/>
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### **For Each Facility**
1. **Facility Name** as a header
2. **Six Cost Cards** showing:
   - Daily Total (current date)
   - Weekly Total (current week)
   - Monthly Total (current month)
   - Quarterly Total (current fiscal quarter)
   - Half-Year Total (current fiscal half-year)
   - Fiscal Year Total (current fiscal year)

### **Real-Time Calculations**
- **Current Date**: Uses today's date for calculations
- **Fiscal Periods**: Properly aligned to April 1 - March 31 fiscal year
- **Rental Periods**: Only includes costs for months within your rental agreement
- **Security Deposits**: Automatically amortized over the specified period

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Data Flow**
1. **AdminPage** fetches facilities from your API
2. **CostSummaryBoxes** receives real facility data
3. **Calculations** are performed using your actual rental terms
4. **Display** shows accurate costs for each facility

### **Calculation Logic**
```typescript
// Step 1: Monthly Total
const monthlyTotal = monthlyRent + (securityDeposit / amortizationPeriodMonths);

// Step 2: All other calculations based on this monthly total
const dailyCost = monthlyTotal / daysInCurrentMonth;
const weeklyCost = dailyCost * 7;
const monthlyCost = monthlyTotal; // Fixed, no proration
// ... etc
```

## 🎨 Visual Features

- **Tablet**: 3 columns per row
- **Mobile**: 1 column per row

## 🔄 Data Updates

The component automatically updates when:
- **Facility data changes** in your database
- **Date changes** (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- **Fiscal periods change** (quarterly, half-yearly, yearly)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Integration**: Check that your facility data displays correctly
2. **Verify Calculations**: Ensure the costs match your expectations
3. **Customize Styling**: Adjust colors or layout if needed
4. **Add More Facilities**: The component will automatically show all facilities

- **Performance**: Efficient rendering even with many facilities

The CostSummaryBoxes component is now fully integrated and ready to display your real facility cost data! 🎉
